Okay so here's the start of the outline. 
Ideas: 
Pong game - PC is actually a overhead of a guy sitting in a chair 
Multiple Characters or Single player with scenario screens 


Colors of player character dependent on what country each character pics 
Countries: USA, Russia, China, Dutch, etc. 
- check NPC characters file for a list of the countries/players 


Will need to create a game board
