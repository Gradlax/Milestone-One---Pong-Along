Grading Rubric
Grading Scale for Milestone Projects
Each milestone project will have skill mastery sections which will receive scores on a scale between 0 and 5. For example, on a milestone project with 5 graded skill mastery sections, the maximum score would be 25 and the minimum score would be 0.
Score

Ability Level

Explanation

5

Expert

The student shows strong competency for this subject, and demonstrates solid understanding of use cases, best practices, and how to execute on the skill being measured.

4

Above Average

The student shows strong competency for this subject, but may have room for improvement, such as DRYer code, following best practices, code effeciency, or overall execution.

3

Meets Expectations

The student has demonstrated enough skill in the subject to earn a passing grade, but they still have far to go in many areas.

2

Emerging

The student is not quite at the level of being competent in the area during independent work. This indicates an "almost there" grade an is an excellent time for academic intervention and increased help.

1

Did Not Demonstrate

This student is not at all close to competent in the subject matter. This may be a time to check in with the student to see whether this is the right time for them to focus on the course or if other obligations in their life may be interfering with coursework.

N/A

Not turned in

Example: Baking a Cake
Imagine the project being graded is baking a cake, and we are grading it in the area of visual appeal.

5: Perfection: Have Your Cake and Eat It Too!
No ideas for improvement come to mind. This cake is unique and visually striking. Almost too pretty to eat. Almost... ðŸ˜‹

4: This Cake is Great!
Nice idea using flavored frosting, but it ended up a little lumpy. Probably mix more thoroughly next time, but overall looks great, would eat!

3: These are Cupcakes from Safeway
They're adequate, they look like cakes, so we're giving you a pass, but they aren't terribly appealing for some reason. Maybe you didn't quite follow instructions or perhaps you're over-relying on templates or other people's work. Perhaps you were afraid to take some risk and stretch yourself for loftier goals?

2: This Cake Got Burnt
This was almost a good cake and something just went awry in the process. It may be good to have a baking mentor there to watch next time you're baking a cake so any bumps in the process can be smoothed out. Everyone makes mistakes, and we definitely still believe you'll be a great baker one day!

1: This is Not a Cake
There are some things in here that don't feel right, like pickles, and the cake was not cooked so it is actually just a bowl full of liquid. Is this the right time for you to be baking cakes? If yes, how can we help you reevaluate and rethink your cake baking process?

0: The Cake is Lie
There is no cake and no way to know if the student baked a cake and threw it away or did nothing at all. This may be a sign that this is a difficult time in this baker's life, they may be frustrated or lost in the cake baking process, so it would be a good idea to check in with them.

Plagiarism & Academic Dishonesty
Recognizing Plagiarism

Comic Source
The internet abounds with memes and comics about how often programmers rely on Google searches or StackOverflow answers. To a certain extent, it's true, as programmers we do rely on the knowledge and expertise of others whether through help or using 3rd party tools someone else has written. Generally, with proper citations, this is considered to be fine. On the other hand, we know that computer science classes can make up a disproportionate amount of cheating incidences at a university. How do we distinguish between the two? What about the gray area in between? Let's start by looking at some examples.

A Good Example
An honest citation might look something like this:

undefinedClick here to copy
Why is this good?

It's pretty clear by looking at this that the person who wrote the code:

Has a good idea of what the code is doing and why it works
Used the code to solve a single issue
Cited the source of any non-original code
Understood the code well enough to adapt the original example to fit their needs
Is aware of other ways to solve the problem and chose this method for a reason
A Bad Example
Alright, now that we've seen a good example with everything done properly, let's look at a blatantly bad example. Let's say the student has been assigned to program a game of tic-tac-toe. Then, they turn in this with a couple variable names changed, which is found in the official React documentation as a tutorial. It's beautiful, it's elegant, it does everything it should and more, and... it's plagiarism.

Even if we don't know that this is a rip directly from ReactJS.org, we can see that:

This definitely goes beyond merely grabbing a line or two for a small task. In this case, the copied code is solving much more than a single problem
This code is more advanced code than the student is expected to be able to produce based on their current skill level
Most likely, the student could not explain specific parts of the code when asked. For example:
Why did you choose to use `Array.fill()`?
What does the `concat()` function do?
Why did you choose to use class-based components vs functional components?
What does the line `xIsNext: !this.state.xIsNext` do?
The source is not cited at all
It can be inferred that the student in the bad example probably used Google to search for "How to Make a Tic-Tac-Toe Game" whereas the student in the good example likely would do multiple smaller searches such as "How to Remove an Event Listener" or "Add a Class to an HTML Element with JavaScript".

Danger Zone: The Gray Area
Despite a significant amount of gray area, we need to draw a line at some reasonable point. For the most part, it comes down to a couple things

Does the student understand what the copied code is doing?
Could the student reproduce the solution with pseudocode?
Does the student believe himself or herself to have written original work?
If the answer to any of these questions is no, it raises a red flag. The possibility of plagiarism is alarming because if not addressed, the student has paid a lot of money and not learned anything from the course in exchange. Additionally, the college/company is at risk of passing students who are not prepared with the skills to do original work resulting in a blow to their reputation.

Plagiarism with Regards to 3rd-Party Libraries/Tools
During a typical programming course, students will use a number of tools, libraries, and frameworks that they didn't write themselves. Generally there is no issue with doing so. A `package.json` or `gemfile` or whatever package configuration file is included in a project includes a reference to the name and version of what tool is being used. It is then reinstalled on whatever machine is running the project.

An occasional gray area issue that comes up where a student cannot figure out how to properly include a plug-in or library in their code. In desperation, they may copy and paste the source code of whatever plug-in they are trying to use into their own project without giving credit. It likely isn't intentional, but the student should get extra help to correct the error in using the plug-in properly in the first place.

Over-Reliance on Associate Instructor Assistance
While this isn't explicitly plagiarism, some students may receive so much help in completing a project from an AI, an instructor, a classmate, or someone else that the code can no longer be said to be completely theirs. This can be combatted a couple different ways:

Ensure AIs are trained on how to lead a student to an answer rather than just giving it to them
Ask AIs to track if any particular student is using a disproportionate amount of tutoring
Ensure that students are aware that the work they turn in must be their own
Encourage students to take the time to comment their code to make sure that they understand what each line of code is doing
Responding to Plagiarism
So, we've identified plagiarism or a case of potential plagiarism. What now?

Intentional, malicious plagiarism for the intent of cheating should not be tolerated. Presumably, students have signed a code of conduct for the university which will cover academic dishonesty. If the student knowingly or egregiously cheated on a project, it should result in expulsion.

Gray area violations should be noted and discussed in writing with the student. Students who consistently skirt the gray area of academic honesty often fall behind their peers. The temptation to over-rely on other people's work should be nipped in the bud. Examples of proper citation and acceptable levels of using 3rd party code should be reviewed and the student should be given a warning in writing that what they've done is not in line with course goals.

License & Copyright Issues
Issues with plagiarism, license, and copyright issues are best addressed proactively by ensuring students know how to properly source code and assets in the first place.

Images / Game Sprites
For images on Google image search, students can be shown how to filter by license.

Click on Tools --> Usage Rights

Filter google images by license by clicking on more tools, then 'usage rights' in the toolbar that appears below the search bar
For projects that aren't being monetized or sold in any way, students can use "Labeled for noncommercial reuse". If the student plans on changing or modifying the image in any way, they can select "Labeled for noncommercial reuse with modification". For students who are concerned with license or copyright issues, they can select "Labeled for reuse" or "Labeled for reuse with modification".
